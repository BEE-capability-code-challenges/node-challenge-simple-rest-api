# Node challenge: Pet Adoption RESTful API

# 1. Overview

This repository is intended to be a quick template to help practice API concepts with NodeJS like HTTP requests, unit tests and API documentation.

A local animal shelter wants to create a website to facilitate pet adoption. The overall project seeks to create a platform that connects potential adopters with pets available for adoption.
The platform should allow admin users to view and manage pet profiles, review, and approve or reject open adoption requests. 
The public side of the API it should allow users to view pets available for adoption as well as submit adoption requests.

    ```

# 4. Instructions

## 4.1 Functional Requirements
In this [link](./resources/functional_requirements.md) you will find the definition of all expected CRUD endpoints.

## 4.2 Business Rules

In this [link](./resources/business_rules.md) you will find the ....

## 4.3 Technical Requirements
* Use TypeScript for server-side development.
* Implement Express.js to create the RESTful API.
* Use SQLite database to store pet and user data.
* Apply proper error handling and validation throughout the application.
* Include unit tests for critical features and components using Jest.

# 5. Testing and Validation Requisites
* The template includes base Unit tests, those must past unchanged
* In case you add extra util functions, those must also. Please add 
* The code coverage must be 100% and passing all in green
* In your submition, include screenshots of the tests passing locally

# 6. Acceptance Criteria

## 6.1 Evaluation criteria

* **Functionality:** Does the application meet the specified requirements?
* **Code quality:** Is the code well structured, readable, and meets best practices?
* **Tests:** Are there unit tests for critical components and do they all pass 100%?
* **Documentation:** Is the project well documented, used JSDoc comments to describe functions, and does it provide clear instructions for setup and use?
